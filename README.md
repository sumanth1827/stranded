This is a fun first person puzzle solving shooter game made using the unity game engine.
The controls are simple.
The game has two core mechanics, shooting and pushing certain objects. The player is supposed to use these to progress through various challenging levels. 
Before playing the actual game the player is adviced to play the tutorial to get used to all the mechanics in the game. The tutorial is available under the controls and the difficulty menus.
This was a fun project made in over 50 days and hope you enjoy playing the game.
Please feel free to give a feedback after completing the game.
